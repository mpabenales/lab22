	If I will be able to design a 1000 floor building, there will be twelve (12) elevator for that building. The 10 elevators will design to open every 10 floors. The system of the elevator will be the first elevator will cater passengers that will be going to floors ending in one (1) (11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91 and so on). Same with the first elevator, the remaining nine (9) elevator will cater according to the last number of the floor they want to go. All elevator will be coming from the ground floor or “G”. The two remaining elevators will cater the VIPs and the PWD. These special elevators are hidden and the people who is entitled to use it will only the people who can access this. For the special elevator, a crew or a butler will assist these special people to the special elevator. There will be a unique code to open it. A little inconvenient? You can request a crew or a butler to assist you. <br><br>
	There will be a keypad inside the elevator to push what floor you desire to go. You can also download an application that is connected to the elevator. So that you can press the button ahead. For example, you want to go to the 116th and you’re at the 99th floor. So, you can press the 116th floor via your mobile phone and you’ll have time to go down to the 96th floor to ride the elevator going to the 116th floor.
