    Our class was divided into 7 groups. I got number 5 which is Cienna’s group. I’m happy that I belong to a group who I’m comfortable with. We decided to make a project about attendance scanner that will cater the students from APC for them to keep their attendance on track and for them to be reminded on how many absents or late they can still have.  I agree with them on some problems that we encountered during our stay here at APC.
