	My experience during Ms. Jen’s class is amazing. I thought she is a strict professor who doesn’t like to “have fun” during her class hours. But Ms. Jen didn’t fail to amaze me how she runs the class smoothly and “happily”. I learned that she’s not that strict at all which makes me feel fine during her class. I also don’t feel any pressure during her class as she freely let us, her students, to explore the learning kits in her class. As well as how the students expresses their ideas in the given problem.
